# Vireo

## What is this?

This is a ready-to-use AI agent that can write code, browse the web, research information,
automate browser tasks, work with files, analyse data and use multiple AI models
automatically.

You install one program. It sets itself up. Then you ask it to do things, in plain English.

**You do not need an API key.** It works out of the box using free models. If you already
pay for Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek or Kimi, you can add your key and it will be
faster — but that is an upgrade, not a requirement.

It also does a second thing: **[Decisions](docs/decisions/)** reads spreadsheets about your
customers and tells you which ones need your attention this week, why, and what to do.

Everything in one page, in plain English. Start there.

> **Windows will say "Windows protected your PC".** That is expected — click
> **More info**, then **Run anyway**. It means nobody has paid for a signing
> certificate, not that the file is bad. The section below explains it properly.
>
> **The first run downloads about 4 GB and takes 10 to 30 minutes.** Once, ever.

## Where this came from

Vireo is a fork of [omni-agent](https://github.com/AnSa30-06/omni-agent), the same
codebase under its previous name. That project's releases are still there and
still work; this one adds **Decisions** and is where new work happens.

The [Releases page](https://github.com/AnSa30-06/vireo/releases/latest) has every
version and its release notes.

### Checking you got the right file

Run this in PowerShell in your Downloads folder before opening it:

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\VireoSetup-1.2.1.exe -Algorithm SHA256
```

It should print:

```
E8E3EE06B5661C9F1B1EBBB90B74A2A9E25CA6258B98E769621C12909E559F9C
```

The portable zip is `0057FDCBC09B82EA7D3B317C1EA8AE98FD802D1124E7AF2843746EE673B9C105`.

If either prints anything else, delete the file and download it again.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Windows version** | Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit |
| **Administrator password** | Not needed |
| **Space to start** | About 380 MB, then about 6 GB once it finishes setting itself up |
| **API key** | Not needed |

### Windows will warn you, and here is why

The download is not code-signed — a signing certificate costs a few hundred pounds a year
and this project does not have one — so Windows SmartScreen shows
**"Windows protected your PC"** the first time you run it. That warning means *"nobody has
paid to vouch for this file"*, not *"this file is known to be bad"*.

To run it anyway: click **More info**, then **Run anyway**.

If you would rather check the file is exactly the one that was published, run this in
PowerShell in your Downloads folder before opening it:

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\OmniAgentSetup-1.2.0.exe -Algorithm SHA256
```

It should print:

```
C69D98347396626CFFDCA1E1AFD0A1AD611F0B85C84F7C0C195E11F8CF9C1DE8
```

If it prints anything else, delete the file and download it again.

---

## Install

1. **Run the file you downloaded.** No administrator password needed.
2. When it finishes, it opens a setup window that downloads the rest and checks everything
   works. This takes a while and needs about 4 GB — see [Disk and download](#disk-and-download).
3. **Launch** *Vireo* from your Desktop or Start Menu — `Vireo.exe`, a real
   application, not a terminal. It opens as a window: Chat on one side, Code on the
   other, with everything else a click away in the sidebar.
   See [The desktop app](docs/desktop-app.md).

That's it. Ask it something.

> Find 10 computer science internships that are open right now, with links.

> Open this website and fill in the form using the details in my CV, but don't submit it.

> Read this spreadsheet and tell me which product line lost money last quarter.

> Write me a Python program that renames all the photos in a folder by their date.

### If you would rather not use an installer

**[⬇ Download the portable zip](https://github.com/AnSa30-06/vireo/releases/latest)** — from the releases page, alongside the installer.

Extract it anywhere, run `setup.bat` once, then `app.bat` to open the app (or `start.bat`
for the terminal interface). Nothing is written outside the folder and your own data
directory, and nothing is added to the registry or the Start Menu.

Its SHA-256 is `b59c59c9261317b3cc70219b06bc7ea522674c876ba44fd317af2cdd2743af76`.

## What it can do

| | |
|---|---|
| **Write and run code** | Any language. It reads your project first, then edits, runs and tests. |
| **Browse the web for real** | A real Chromium browser. It clicks, types, fills forms, switches tabs, downloads files, and handles JavaScript-heavy sites. |
| **Search and read the web** | Searches, then actually fetches the pages before quoting them. Cites the URL it really loaded. |
| **Scrape and crawl** | Bulk extraction from one page or a whole site section. |
| **Documents** | Reads PDF, Word, Excel, CSV, JSON, text and Markdown. Writes CSV, Excel, JSON, Markdown. |
| **Data analysis** | Profiles a spreadsheet — types, missing values, statistics — without spending tokens on it. |
| **Git and GitHub** | Branches, commits, pull requests, issues. |
| **Choose its own model** | Picks a cheap fast model for simple work and a strong one for hard work. |
| **Turn customer data into decisions** | **Decisions**: reads your customer spreadsheets, finds the accounts where several things changed at once, and gives you a short list of things to act on — with the evidence. [Read more](docs/decisions/). |

### It stops before doing anything irreversible

Filling in a form and stopping is the **normal** outcome. Before it submits anything, sends
anything, buys anything, publishes anything or deletes anything, it stops and asks you
about that specific action. That is enforced in code and no setting turns it off.

It will not defeat CAPTCHAs, bot checks or access controls.

## Disk and download

Be aware of this before you start:

| Component | Size | When |
|---|---|---|
| The installer itself | ~52 MB | download |
| Node.js runtime | ~80 MB | bundled in the installer |
| Model gateway (OmniRoute) | ~2.7 GB | first run |
| Agent harness (OpenCode) | ~514 MB | first run |
| Chromium browser | ~700 MB | first run |

Roughly **6 GB** of disk once fully set up. The big components are downloaded on first run
rather than bundled, because an installer carrying them would be unusable.

---

## Usage and cost

Run `vireo usage`, or just ask the agent "what model am I on and what is this
costing?".

**The numbers you see are real or they are absent.** This product never estimates a quota
or a balance. Providers differ in what they publish, and the dashboard says which is which:

- **DeepSeek** and **OpenRouter** publish a live balance — you see it.
- **Anthropic** and **OpenAI** publish usage only to *Admin* keys — without one, it says
  "unavailable" and tells you why.
- **Google** publishes nothing for Gemini API keys — it says so.
- Token counts come from what each API response actually reported, and are labelled
  "provider-reported".
- Speed is measured on your machine from real calls. A model you have not used yet shows
  "not measured yet", not a number.

Capability rankings ("strong", "elite") are this project's own editorial estimates, kept in
[`config/models/metadata.json`](config/models/metadata.json). They are **not** benchmark
scores and are never presented as such.

---

## Spending fewer tokens

Free tiers have limits, and most of what an agent spends is tool output — test
runs, file reads, search results — not conversation.

```bash
vireo saving
```

That lists every tier with the saving **measured on your own recent requests**,
locally, through the gateway's preview endpoint. Nothing here quotes a brochure
figure as if it were a measurement.

| Tier | Targets | Measured on an agent-shaped payload |
|---|---|---|
| `max` | tool output + conversation | 96.7% |
| `tools` | tool output only | 93.9% |
| `balanced` | conversation | 3.8% |
| `safe` | everything, lightly | 3.8% |
| `high` | conversation | 0.7% |
| `off` | nothing | 0% |

**`tools` is the default**: nearly all of the saving, and your conversation is
sent exactly as written. Code, URLs and structured data are never compressed at
any tier.

```bash
vireo saving max
```

> The seven underlying modes are not one dial — some target prose and some
> target tool output, which is why `high` saves less than `tools` here. The list
> is ordered by what it actually measured rather than by an invented intensity
> scale.

---

## More free capacity

```bash
vireo provider
```

Fifteen providers with a genuine free tier, what each one gives you, and where
to get the key. Add one and it is tested immediately with a real call:

```bash
vireo provider add cerebras csk-...
```

Already paying for Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, Cursor or Gemini? Sign in and the
agent uses that subscription — nothing is charged twice:

```bash
vireo provider signin claude
```

### Anything else the gateway knows

The fifteen are curated. The gateway itself knows **222 providers**, and any of
them can be added by id — `mistral`, `cerebras`, `groq`, `cohere`, `together`,
`sambanova`, `nebius`, `novita`, `deepinfra`, `hyperbolic`, `openrouter`:

```bash
vireo provider setup mistral      # the steps
vireo provider add mistral YOUR-KEY
```

Its models then appear in the picker under **From your keys**. A full worked
example and the id list are in
[docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md#adding-one-of-the-free-providers-yourself).

**Chasing the dashboard's "1.6 billion free tokens"?** It is 1,526,225,000 **a
month**, it is a sum over ~40 accounts you would open yourself, and **two thirds
of it is Mistral alone** — six signups reach 93%. Which six, where to sign up,
and what each is worth: **[docs/free-tiers.md](docs/free-tiers.md)**.

⚠️ **Being in the gateway's manifest is not evidence that a provider works.**
GitHub Models is still listed there and was retired on 2026-07-30; its endpoint
answers HTTP 410.

### Search keys

Search works with **no key at all** — DuckDuckGo, then Brave's public results
page, then public SearXNG instances, then the bundled browser. Those free
endpoints throttle a machine that searches in bursts, which is exactly what
research looks like. A key removes that.

Every provider comes with step-by-step instructions:

```bash
vireo provider setup brave
```

```
Brave Search - Free credits every month on an independent web index

  1. Open https://brave.com/search/api/ and pick the 'Search' plan.
  2. Create a Brave account, or sign in.
  3. $5 of free credit every month, applied automatically.
  4. In the developer dashboard, create a subscription token.
  5. Run:  vireo provider add brave YOUR-KEY

  Check it worked:  vireo doctor
```

Once a key is stored it is used **first**, automatically — nothing to
configure. Brave is the one to add first: an independent index, so it does not
fail at the same moment as DuckDuckGo.

---

## The dashboard

The bundled gateway is a full web application running on your own machine —
providers, compression, analytics, search tools, settings.

```bash
vireo dashboard          # overview
vireo dashboard search   # search and scraping providers
vireo dashboard free     # every provider with a free allowance
```

It asks for a password, which setup generated for you. The command prints it and
copies it to your clipboard. The dashboard is not reachable from any other
computer.

---

## Choosing a model

The agent routes automatically. Five modes:

| Mode | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `fast` | Highest throughput, lowest latency |
| `balanced` | The default |
| `smart` | The strongest model that is still reasonably efficient |
| `quality` | The strongest suitable model, cost be damned |
| `cheap` | The cheapest model that can still do the job |

```bash
vireo config mode smart
```

The mode picks the agent's own model as well as the models it uses internally, so changing
it prints which model you will be on and asks you to restart — OpenCode reads its
configuration at launch and does not reload it.

Or ask it: *"switch to the cheapest model"*. To pin one specific model, `vireo models`
lists what is available right now, and the agent's `agent_status` tool can pin it.

Simple work (classifying, naming, extracting a field) is deliberately sent to a cheap fast
model even in `quality` mode. Spending an elite model on a title is the single easiest way
to waste a budget.

```

**Composition, not forking.** OpenCode and OmniRoute are used unmodified, through their
documented extension points: an OpenCode plugin for the tools, OmniRoute's own first-party
OpenCode plugin for the models. Not one line of either project is patched.

**Isolation.** The bundled gateway runs on its own port with its own data directory, and
OpenCode is pointed at a private config directory. Installing this cannot disturb an
existing `omniroute` or `opencode` setup, and uninstalling it cannot take theirs with it.

### Tool count is a budget

Every tool description is spent from the model's context on **every turn**. So the whole
browser — navigate, snapshot, click, type, select, upload, tabs, extract, screenshot,
download, wait — is *one* tool with an `action` argument, not eighteen tools. Eight tools
total.

---

## Decisions

A second thing in the same window, for anyone who has customers rather than a
codebase.

You give it a folder of spreadsheets — accounts, daily usage, contacts, support
tickets, invoices. It works out what changed for every customer, finds the ones
where **several** things moved together, and asks an AI to explain what it means
and what to do. You get a short list. Each item carries its evidence and the
money at stake.

Then it remembers. A decision stays until you close it, tells you when it is
overdue, and asks what actually happened.

```bash
vireo decisions              # open it
vireo decisions seed demo    # 48 made-up customers to try it on
vireo decisions run          # analyse, from a terminal
```

Two rules it does not break:

- **Every number was computed from your data, not written by an AI.** The
  software does the arithmetic; the model only reads sentences the software wrote
  and writes the explanation. An answer containing a figure that is not in your
  data is thrown away and asked for again.
- **One thing changing is never a decision.** It takes a combination. That rule
  is in code, so it holds even when the model is unavailable — and when it is,
  the decision is still raised, from the rules, and says so.

Nothing is sent anywhere. There is no code in it that can send an email, and the
only thing that leaves your machine is a short, name-free fact sheet about one
customer, and only when you run an analysis.
[Privacy](docs/decisions/privacy.md) shows exactly what that is.

**Start with [Getting started](docs/decisions/getting-started.md)**, and read
[Limitations](docs/decisions/limitations.md) before relying on it.

## Security

- Credentials are encrypted with **Windows DPAPI**, bound to your Windows account. No
  native module, no plaintext key file.
- Nothing is logged that looks like a secret — every log write and the diagnostics export
  both pass through redaction, and the exporter **aborts** rather than emit a bundle that
  still matches a secret pattern.
- Genuinely destructive shell commands are refused outright, whatever permission profile is
  selected.
- Telemetry is local-only. Nothing about your usage leaves the machine.

Details in [docs/security.md](docs/security.md).

---

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit
- ~6 GB free disk
- An internet connection for setup

macOS and Linux work from source (`npm install && node bin/vireo.mjs setup`); only the
Windows installer is built today.
