# Sending Vireo to someone else

Two things make the difference between "here is an app" and "here is an app that
works": they should not have to sign up for anything, and they should not have to
know what an API key is.

---

## 1. Put a provider key inside the build

Vireo runs with no key at all, but only a handful of free models still answer and
they are slow. A single free key turns that into over a thousand models.

You can ship **your** key inside the build, so the person you send it to opens the
app and it simply works.

```bash
vireo bundle-key mistral YOUR-MISTRAL-KEY
```

It checks the key with a real call before saving it, so a mistyped key is caught
on your machine rather than on theirs.

```bash
vireo bundle-key show     # which providers are bundled (names only)
vireo bundle-key clear    # remove it
```

### 🔴 The key never enters git, and that is enforced

`bundled-key.json` is in `.gitignore`, and `tests/unit/bundled-key.test.mjs`
asks git on every test run whether it is still ignored. That test exists because
**this repository is public**, and because `npm run scan:secrets` only reads what
git *tracks* — an ignored file is invisible to it. The test is what closes that
gap.

So the key lives in exactly two places: your working copy, and the installer you
hand over.

### Which key to use

Get a free one from <https://console.mistral.ai/>. Mistral's free tier is by far
the largest of the free providers — on the order of two thirds of all the free
capacity Vireo knows about.

**Use a key you are willing to have used by someone else.** Whoever you send the
build to can make requests with it. If that matters, make a separate key for
this and delete it later.

## 1b. Vireo is self-contained, on purpose

Vireo downloads its own model gateway, its own agent and its own browser, into its
own data directory. It never reads another program's install, and nothing it does
depends on what else is on the machine.

🗑️ **Removed 2026-09-15: sharing components with an OmniAgent install.** Version
1.2.1 detected an OmniAgent install and reused its gateway, agent and Chromium to
skip about 4 GB of downloading. It is gone, and it is not coming back.

**Why it was removed.** Both apps start a model gateway on the same port (20129),
so the two installs fought whenever both were open. That made Vireo's behaviour
depend on whether an unrelated program happened to be running, which is not a
property a working install should have. Anmol's call:

> *"That just messes things up when you download both software programs on your
> laptop. Keep it self-contained. I'm okay with re-downloading the models and
> whatnot."*

`tests/unit/self-contained.test.mjs` fails if anyone re-introduces it.

**What this costs the person you send it to:** the full download, once. See step 3.

## 2. Build the installer

```bash
npm run build:installer     # dist/VireoSetup-<version>.exe
npm run build:portable      # dist/Vireo-Portable-<version>.zip
```

The build prints a line confirming the key went in:

```
  Bundled provider key included: mistral
```

If you do not see that line, the key is not in the build. Run `vireo bundle-key
show` and check.

Send them **the .exe**. It is a per-user install, so it needs no administrator
password.

## 3. What they will see

1. Windows SmartScreen says *"Windows protected your PC"*, because the file is
   not code-signed. **Tell them about this before you send it**, or they will
   assume it is a virus. They click **More info**, then **Run anyway**.
2. It installs, then downloads the parts that are too big to ship — the model
   gateway, the agent and a browser. About 4 GB, ten to thirty minutes, once.
3. Setup connects your bundled key and says so.
4. They open Vireo. Models work with no signup.

Point them at:

- **[docs/decisions/getting-started.md](decisions/getting-started.md)** if you
  want them to look at Decisions.
- The main [README](../README.md) for the agent side.

The fastest thing to tell someone to try:

> Open Vireo, click **Decisions**, load the demo company, and press Run.

## What to say about privacy

Worth being straight with them, because it is their data:

- Everything runs on their machine. There is no account and no server of ours.
- Their files are never uploaded.
- When they use the agent, their prompts go to whichever model is serving them —
  with a bundled key, that is Mistral, under **your** account.
- In Decisions, the only thing that leaves the machine is a short fact sheet
  about one customer, with names replaced by codes by default.
  [docs/decisions/privacy.md](decisions/privacy.md) shows an example.

## Renaming it again

The product name is one command:

```bash
node scripts/rename-product.mjs --to "Some Name" --slug some-name --dry
node scripts/rename-product.mjs --to "Some Name" --slug some-name
```

It renames files, contents, the CLI, the environment variables and the data
directory, and deliberately leaves the upstream OmniRoute and OpenCode projects
and every real URL alone. Run the tests afterwards.

⚠️ It changes the data directory (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Vireo`), so an existing
install's workspaces and decisions will not be found by the renamed build. That
is usually what you want for a fork; it is not what you want for an upgrade.
