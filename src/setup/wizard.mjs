 * the interface emits 'close' and the promise is simply left PENDING FOREVER.

 * printed its welcome banner, stopped at "Press Enter to continue...", and

 *
 * A silent success for work that was never done is the worst failure this
 * product can produce, so the question is raced against the interface closing
 * and a dead stdin simply yields the default.
