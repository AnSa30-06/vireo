// Getting more free capacity into the product.
//
// The gateway can reach 222 providers and 90+ of them have a free tier, but a
// fresh install uses none of them: it runs on whatever keyless pool the gateway
// finds, which is slow and rate-limited. Every free key a user adds is more
// headroom, and the whole point of this module is that adding one should take
// a minute and not require understanding what a base URL is.
//
// Three distinct ways in, and they are genuinely different things:
//
//   models   paste a free API key            -> a gateway provider connection
//   signIn   OAuth into a subscription you   -> a gateway provider connection
//            already pay for
//   search   paste a free search key         -> this product's own search stack,
//                                              NOT the gateway
//
// The catalogue in config/providers/free.json is curated; the base URL and auth
// mechanics come from the gateway's own manifest so nothing here goes stale
// when OmniRoute changes a provider.
