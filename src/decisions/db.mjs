// The Decisions database: one SQLite file per workspace.
//
// WHY SQLITE AND NOT THE JSON FILES THE REST OF THIS APP USES. Decisions,
// events and signals are relational, they are queried with filters, and the
// history table is append-only and grows without bound. `node:sqlite` ships
// with the bundled Node 24 runtime, needs no dependency and no native module,
// and is already used elsewhere in this codebase (gatewayRepair in
// src/ui/api.mjs). A JSON file rewritten on every decision update would lose a
// write the first time two things happened at once.
//
// MIGRATIONS are an ordered array of SQL strings. `meta.schema_version` records
// how many have been applied; a start applies the rest inside one transaction.
// Never edit a migration that has shipped - append a new one.
import { DatabaseSync } from "node:sqlite";
// ⚠️ A DELIBERATE IMPORT CYCLE. These three modules import nowIso/getSettings/tx
// back from this file, and what they import back are FUNCTION DECLARATIONS,
// which are hoisted, so their module bodies see real bindings rather than a
// temporal-dead-zone error. It would break if any of them ever CALLED one of
// those at module top level - none does.
//
// 🔴 FUNCTIONS, NOT CONSTANTS, AND THE REASON IS MEASURED. This used to import
// METRICS_MIGRATION / STORY_MIGRATION / EMBED_MIGRATION, which are `const`. The
// old comment claimed ESM finishes evaluating each of them before this file's
// body runs. THAT IS ONLY TRUE WHEN THIS FILE IS REACHED FIRST. Import
// embed.mjs directly and the order inverts: this file's body runs while
// embed.mjs's has not, the const is in the temporal dead zone, and the import
// throws "Cannot access 'EMBED_MIGRATION' before initialization" before a line
// of code runs. Three of the twenty-four modules in this folder could not be
// imported on their own, and the whole test suite was green, because every test
// happened to reach db.mjs first.
//
// A hoisted function declaration is callable the moment the module is
// instantiated, before its body runs. Verified both ways with a two-file cycle:
// the const threw, the function returned its string. Keep these as calls.
