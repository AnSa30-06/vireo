// Opening the gateway's own dashboard.
//
// The bundled gateway is a full web application - 142 pages of providers,
// compression studios, analytics, search tools and settings - and until now
// nothing in this product ever told the user it was there. It is running on
// their machine either way.
//
// It sits behind a password we generate during setup and store; the user has
// never seen it. This module shows it to them so they can sign in. It does NOT
// type it for them: filling a password field on someone's behalf is not this
// program's job, and a person who cannot see the password cannot use the
// dashboard from any other browser either.
