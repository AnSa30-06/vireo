//
// Why this exists at all: the OmniRoute OpenCode plugin refuses to register its
// provider block unless it finds a non-empty api key in OpenCode's auth.json
// ("config shim skipped: no apiKey"). Our gateway runs with REQUIRE_API_KEY
// false, so inference does not need one - but OpenCode will not see any models
// without it. So setup must mint a real key rather than leave the user to.
//
// The mechanism is OmniRoute's own supported CLI flow: POST /api/cli/connect
// with the instance's management password returns a scoped token. We generated
// that password ourselves in ensureGatewayEnv(), so no human has to type
// anything, and the token is admin-scoped, which is also what unlocks the
// /api/* quota and pricing endpoints the usage dashboard needs.
