// Owns the lifecycle of the bundled OmniRoute process.
//
// Two properties matter here:
//  1. Isolation. We set DATA_DIR to our own directory and use our own port, so
//     installing this product never disturbs a pre-existing `omniroute` install
//     (which keeps its data in ~/.omniroute on :20128).
//  2. Per-install secrets. The npm package ships a .env with default
//     JWT_SECRET / API_KEY_SECRET / STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY values. Those are
//     fine for a local dev toy and wrong for a distribution, because every
//     install would share them. We generate our own on first run.
