/* -- Windows file and folder dialogs -------------------------------------
 *
 * THE BUG THESE EXIST TO FIX, and the first version's comment claimed the fix
 * while the code did not implement it: a WinForms dialog shown from a process
 * that has never had foreground opens BEHIND the app. The button says "waiting
 * for the folder picker..." forever, the user clicks again, and each click
 * stacks another invisible dialog. Measured 2026-08-28 against the shipped
 * 1.1.2: three orphaned "Browse For Folder" windows sitting behind the app.
 *
 * What fixes it is an owner window that EXISTS - see the note on DIALOG_OWNER
 * for what "exists" has to mean here, because the obvious way to make one
 * (Show it) breaks the dialog outright.
 *
 * And only ever one at a time. Without the guard a second click is a second
 * dialog, and that pile-up is what made a window in the wrong place look like a
 * freeze.
 */

// The owner is a real window, parked off-screen at 1x1, that is never SHOWN.
//
// 🔴 `$owner.Show()` is the trap, and it is a worse bug than the one it was
// meant to fix. The picker is spawned with `windowsHide: true`, which starts
// the process with a one-shot SW_HIDE that Windows applies to the first window
// the process shows - so Show() consumes it on the owner, the owner is hidden,
// and the dialog it owns is hidden with it. Measured 2026-08-28: with Show()
// the child exits code 0 in under a second, prints nothing, and the app reports
// a cancelled picker that the user never saw.
//
// ⭐ Touching `.Handle` creates the window WITHOUT calling ShowWindow, so the
// SW_HIDE is never spent and the dialog opens normally - measured at z-order 3
// of 17 with the app window at 17, i.e. comfortably in front. `Form.TopMost` is
// left off deliberately: it is a no-op on a form that was never shown, and
// SetWindowPos(HWND_TOPMOST) on the owner was measured to change nothing about
// where the dialog lands. It is in front; it does not need to outrank
// everything on the desktop.
