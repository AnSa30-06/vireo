// Starting the desktop app.
//
// The window opens FIRST and shows what is happening; the gateway and the
// agent are started after it. Before this the order was gateway, then agent,
// then window, which is right for the wiring (see bringUp) and wrong for the
// person waiting: measured 2026-09-02, the gateway took 28 s to answer on a
// cold start and the agent 3 s more, and for all of that the exe put nothing
// on screen. That reads as "it did not work", and the natural response -
// double-click again - started a second copy of everything. Now the page is up
// in well under a second and shows each step as it happens (see startup.mjs).
//
// Inside bringUp the order is still load-bearing: the OmniRoute plugin
// registers this product's models by asking the gateway for them when OpenCode
// boots; if the gateway is not up yet the plugin registers nothing, OpenCode
// silently falls back to its own provider, and the user gets "Model
// x-preview-f-free is not supported" on their first message. Measured
// 2026-08-27 - so the gateway starts first and the agent server second, always.
