// Keep an installed copy up to date by fetching only what changed.
//
// WHY NOT THE INSTALLER. A release installer is 74.6 MB and unpacks to a 3.4 GB
// tree, almost all of which is node_modules and a bundled Node runtime that
// change perhaps twice a year. The files that actually change between releases
// are the app's own source: measured between v1.1.13 and v1.2.0, eleven files
// and 463 changed lines. Downloading those is a few hundred kilobytes.
//
// WHY NOT `git pull`. The install is not a git checkout and the reader has no
// git. GitHub's compare API gives the same answer over plain HTTPS.
//
// 🔴 THE RULE THIS MODULE EXISTS TO ENFORCE: copying files into a live install
// is only safe while the SHAPE of the install is unchanged. If a release
// renames the program, or needs a package that is not already on disk, the
// copied files land in a tree that cannot run them - and the reader is left
// with an app that will not start and no obvious way back. Every such release
// is refused here and sent to the full installer instead.
//
// That is not hypothetical. While this was being written, HEAD of this very
// repository had renamed the product, moved its data directory and added a
// `zod` dependency across 90 files. A naive file-copier would have replaced
// `bin/vireo.mjs` with nothing, pointed the app at an empty data folder,
// and imported a package that is not installed.
import fs from "node:fs";
import path from "node:path";

// test it is to point it at the real install and hope.
